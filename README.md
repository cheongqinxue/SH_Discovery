### Information Extraction

These demos show how NER, coreferencing and SRL come together to identify people, organisations and other entities mentioned in text, and the actions or events that involve them. Each demo will display a list of captured NERs and spans in the text that refer to them. 

The specific use case here is to extract statements made by people or organisations, so SRL picks out statements made and attributes them to one of the captured entities.

#### Identifying stakeholders to investigate

Statements can be extracted and analysed in aggregate. We can figure out who was talking about an entity of interest and study the average sentiments of the statements made about that entity. Using articles in Aug 21, the following depicts the average sentiment of statements made by various persons/organisations that mention Amazon.

The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union's (RWDSU) statements are negative on average - not surprising since they are accusing Amazon of [wrongdoing during a union election](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cheongqinxue/SH_Discovery/blob/main/Information%20Extraction%20Demos/demo_a.html).

Similar plots studying the sentiments of statements made that mention Facebook and the United States Postal Service respectively:

#### How are the stakeholders related?

As it turns out, one of those in the diagram above, Stuart Appelbaum, works for the RWDSU. That was discovered using entity relation extraction. Using the same technique, other people related to RWDSU were also detected:

The same can also be done at scale. Some of the larger relationship networks discovered using the same method:<br>
